# Sourcceleration
A program based on Povohat's acceleration driver which will replicate the mouse acceleration of the Source Engine without the FPS based variance.
<br>
<br>
Credits to: Povohat for the base, Valve for the acceleration curve, and Francisco Lopes for the interception library.
<br>
The interception library <b>(required)</b> can be obtained here: https://github.com/oblitum/Interception
#Setting up and building
Once you've downloaded the interception library, create a folder in the Sourcceleration folder named "libs"
<br>
Place the "x64" and "x86" folders in that folder.
<br>
Open the project and build it in release<b>(!)</b>, make sure the mode is x64<b>(!)</b> which is the only mode currently supported actively by me.
<br>
Go to the x64 folder
<br>
Open the release folder
<br>
Make sure that Sourcceleration.exe and interception.dll are in the same folder.
<br>
Open settings.txt and configure it to your liking.
<br>
Once you have configured settings.txt and saved it, run Sourcceleration.exe.
